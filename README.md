# Python-Contact-Manager
This is an old project from my CS230 python class.

Essentially, what this code does is it creats a menu in the command window, giving you the option to view, create, and delete contacts
from a file, creating a contact listing that includes their name, number, and email address. Some test numbers and names have been added
for the sake of examples.
